## Game-Specific Routing

Issues in game repos are handled by that game's dev team.
Cross-game issues go to the studio repo (jellybolt-games).

## Escalation Path

1. **Blocked?** → Tag Mario (picard) on the issue
2. **Security concern?** → Tag Toad (worf) immediately
3. **Architecture question?** → Create issue in studio repo, tag Mario
4. **Revenue/legal question?** → Tag both Mario + Toad
